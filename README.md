# Twitch-Platform-App
This is an app designed to clone the idea of Twitch using Twitch API. The idea is to implement a content based recommendation system on a web-app, where it takes the search history and favorite record as parameters to recommend stream/clips/videos.


## Overview
### About this Project
1. Design Phase: Used Figma to design the UI.
2. Frontend: Used React JS and Ant Design React library.
3. Backend: Used Spring MVC and Java Servelet on game service queries.
4. Databases: Used MySQL and connect with Spring Hibernate.
5. Deployment: Deployed to Amazon EC2 for better performance.
6. Fetures: Signup, Login, Search Twitch resources(Stream/Clips/Videos), Get Recommendation.

### Purpose / Critical User Journey
1. want to Gain Practice on using Spring in web-application
2. The current recommendation system that Twitch used does not fit my personal preferrence.
